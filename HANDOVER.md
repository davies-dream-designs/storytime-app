**Branch:** `main`  
**Live URL:** https://storycot.com

**Latest production merge:** `c1f56bc Merge pull request #27 from davies-dream-designs/feat/ui-consistency-pass`

## Current Handoff - 2026-07-17

Local checkout is synced to `origin/main` at `c1f56bc`. The working tree was clean after sync.

PR #27 merged the accumulated print book, UI consistency, credit enforcement, localization, EPUB compression, and production readiness work into `main`. Vercel production deployed successfully and is aliased to `https://storycot.com` and `https://www.storycot.com`.

### What Shipped

- Print/illustrated book pipeline improvements:
  - Illustrated PDF and EPUB exports.
  - Text-only EPUB export for stories.
  - Kindle-friendly illustrated EPUB compression, with tests covering file-size budget.
  - Incomplete/placeholder art batches now fail cleanly instead of shipping broken output.
  - Book status supports useful failure and retry/repair states.
- Inngest pipeline:
  - Inngest remains opt-in via `BOOK_PIPELINE_DRIVER=inngest`.
  - Preview and production Vercel envs have Inngest keys configured.
  - User confirmed both Inngest apps are now synced.
- Credit/pricing enforcement:
  - Plain story cost is `1` credit.
  - Illustrated book cost is `8` credits.
  - Illustrated generation reserves/captures/refunds credits server-side so failed output does not permanently burn paid value.
- Stripe:
  - Checkout success/cancel URLs derive from the current request origin and locale.
  - Stripe Checkout locale is localized from the active app locale where supported.
  - Dev checkout should stay on `dev.storycot.com`; prod should stay on `storycot.com`.
- UI consistency:
  - Added reusable button/form styling primitives.
  - Profile and new-story forms were brought onto shared styling.
  - Story and dashboard cards now share `StoryCard`.
  - Story/book library filters use shared collection filter components.
  - Share/read/delete actions are visually aligned.
  - Friendly app error/not-found pages replaced raw framework error surfaces.
- Localization:
  - Locale metadata is centralized.
  - Clerk localization is centralized.
  - Added German, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch.
  - Middleware now derives public locale routes from centralized locale config.
- Cleanup:
  - Legacy broken book-project records were removed via a temporary protected admin route.
  - The temporary cleanup route was deleted before merge.

### Validation Before Production Merge

Run locally before merging PR #27:

```
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

All passed. Vercel production deployment for `c1f56bc` reached `Ready`.

### Important Files Added/Changed

- `src/lib/credits.ts` - credit reservation/capture/refund helpers.
- `src/lib/pricing.ts` - central credit costs.
- `src/app/api/books/[id]/build/route.ts` - illustrated build charging.
- `src/lib/print-books/jobs.ts` - refund-safe book job behavior.
- `src/lib/print-books/epub.ts` - EPUB image compression.
- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/buttonStyles.ts`
- `src/components/ui/formStyles.ts`
- `src/components/StoryCard.tsx`
- `src/components/BooksLibrary.tsx`
- `src/components/library/CollectionFilters.tsx`
- `src/components/profiles/ProfileFormControls.tsx`
- `src/components/ErrorState.tsx`
- `src/app/[locale]/error.tsx`
- `src/app/global-error.tsx`
- `src/i18n/locales.ts`
- `src/i18n/clerk.ts`
- `src/middleware.ts`

### Runtime QA Still Worth Doing

- Generate one illustrated book on `dev.storycot.com` and confirm the event lands in the preview/staging Inngest app.
- Generate one illustrated book on `storycot.com` and confirm the event lands in the production Inngest app.
- Confirm successful illustrated output charges `8` credits and failed output refunds or avoids capture.
- Download finished illustrated EPUB/PDF on phone/Kindle and confirm file size, cover/title, and open/share behavior.
- Run one real Stripe success and cancel flow on dev and prod, confirming neither environment bounces to the other.
- If Inngest sync/invocation fails:
  - No event appears: check `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` for that Vercel environment.
  - Event appears but endpoint fails: check `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` and endpoint sync URL.
  - Preview endpoint behind Vercel protection should include the automation bypass query param when synced manually.

### Current Operational Notes

- Production branch is protected; merge to `main` requires a PR.
- `main` auto-deploys production through Vercel.
- `feat/ui-consistency-pass` remains on origin but has been merged.
- OpenAI billing needs topping up before heavy real illustrated QA.
- Hardcover/print fulfillment cost modeling is intentionally not included in credit pricing yet.

## Core Features

### Authentication
- Clerk v7 with email + Google OAuth (production)
- Facebook OAuth — enabled, needs App Review for email scope
- Apple OAuth — enabled but no credentials yet (skip for now — complex setup)
- Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` — intl redirect runs BEFORE auth.protect() to prevent sign-in loop

### Credits System
- New users get 3 free credits (set via Clerk `privateMetadata.credits`)
- Admin users (`privateMetadata.isAdmin = true`) get unlimited
- Stripe credit packs: top up via one-time payment
- Webhook at `/api/stripe/webhook` increments credits on `checkout.session.completed`
- **Stripe key rule:** Only use `rk_live_` restricted key in `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, never `sk_live_`

### Story Generation
- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Prompt: `src/lib/storyGenerator.ts` — `buildStoryPrompt()`
- Language: passed via `locale` param — Claude writes in EN/ES/FR/ZH
- Suggestions cached in KV: key = `suggestions:{profileId}:{locale}` (24hr TTL)
- Story content stored as-is in the language it was generated — no translation after the fact

### Multilingual (i18n)
- Path-based routing: `/en/`, `/es/`, `/fr/`, `/zh/`
- All UI strings in `messages/*.json`
- Translation namespaces: `nav`, `home`, `dashboard`, `profiles`, `stories`, `account`, `share`, `common`
- `home.themes` keys used for both landing page badges and story card theme labels
- Theme slugs stored in DB as English lowercase (e.g. `"bravery"`) — mapped to `tKey` in `THEME_CONFIG`

### Sharing
- Story share: POST `/api/stories/[id]/share` → generates a token stored in KV
- Share URL: `storycot.com/[locale]/s/[token]` — publicly accessible, no auth
- Share page UI translates to viewer's locale; story content stays in generation language

## Known Issues / Gotchas

1. **Clerk production `0/3 setup tasks`** — Domain DNS setup for `clerk.storycot.com` still needs completing. Until done, production auth won't fully work.
2. **Facebook OAuth App Review** — FB requires review before `email` scope works for non-test users. Submit in Meta Developer Console.
3. **storycot.com.au domain** — Issue #9 open. Not set up yet.
4. **Stripe live/restricted key** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` must be `rk_live_*` (restricted), never `sk_live_*`.
5. **KV → Postgres migration** — Issue #6. Currently all data is in Vercel KV (Redis). No SQL, no relational queries. Long-term plan to move to Postgres for better querying.
6. **Existing stories are English** — Stories generated before multilingual was deployed are stored in English. No migration path — generate new ones in the desired language.
7. **OpenAI image rate limits** — `feat/print-book-preview` currently hits OpenAI's 5 images/min limit under multi-user load. Retry logic exists but the architectural fix (Inngest + OpenAI Batch API) is the agreed next step — not yet built.

## Print Book Feature (`feat/print-book-preview`)

**Worktree:** `/home/openhands/workspaces/storycot-printbook-preview`  
**Status:** All committed and pushed. Not yet merged to main.

### What's built
- Lulu 8.5"×8.5" square hardcover spec PDF generation (cover + interior, 630×630pt pages)
- Per-page 1024×1024 square illustrations (`leftPageImageUrl` + `rightPageImageUrl` per spread, replaces shared landscape)
- 8-direction black text outline on story text + page numbers for readability over illustrations
- Step-by-step build pipeline: `BookBuildJob` with `artGenerationCursor`, chained via Next.js `after()`
- 429 retry with wait time parsed from OpenAI error body; sequential (not parallel) image gen per spread
- Moderation-blocked images retry without page text before failing
- Story page shows "View print book" button once a book exists (translation key fixed)

### Key files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/print-books/pdf.ts` | PDF renderer — cover, interior, frontispiece, page layout |
| `src/lib/print-books/illustrations.ts` | OpenAI image gen, placeholder SVGs, rate limit handling |
| `src/lib/print-books/jobs.ts` | Book build job pipeline (`processBookBuildJob`, `enqueueBookBuildJob`) |
| `src/app/api/books/[id]/build/route.ts` | Build trigger API route |
| `src/app/api/book-jobs/[jobId]/run/route.ts` | Job step runner |
| `src/types/printBook.ts` | `BookSpread`, `BookProject`, `BookBuildJob` types |

### Agreed next step — Inngest + OpenAI Batch API
Replace `after()` chains with **Inngest** (proper job queue, rate limiting, concurrency control) and replace per-image OpenAI calls with **OpenAI Batch API** (`/v1/images/generations` is supported, 50% discount, no per-minute limits).

**Flow:** Build triggers → Inngest job → planning/bible/spreads compose → submit ALL images as one OpenAI batch → Inngest polls for batch completion → images stored → PDFs generated → book ready.

**Start here in new session:**
1. Install `inngest` + `@inngest/next`
2. Create Inngest client and Next.js serve handler at `src/app/api/inngest/route.ts`
3. Migrate `regenerateProjectArt` into an Inngest function with concurrency limits
4. Replace per-image OpenAI calls with a batch submission function
5. Add Inngest polling loop for batch completion
